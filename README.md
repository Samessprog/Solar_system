# Solar_system

Solar_system is an interactive 3D simulation of the solar system built using Three.js. Users can explore the solar system, navigate between planets, and view detailed information about each celestial body.

## Description

Solar_system provides a realistic representation of our solar system, allowing users to interact with it in a 3D environment. The simulation features accurately scaled planets and their orbits around the Sun. Each planet rotates on its axis and orbits the Sun according to real-world physics. Users can navigate through the solar system using their mouse and select planets from a menu for detailed views.

## Features

- **Interactive Exploration:** Users can move around the solar system and navigate between planets using their mouse.
- **Realistic Scaling and Orbits:** Planets are represented with accurate scaling and orbital paths. Each planet's orbit is color-coded to match the planet.
- **Planet Selection Menu:** A menu displays the names of all planets in the solar system. Users can select a planet from this menu to smoothly transition to a close-up view of the chosen planet.
- **Detailed Planet View:** When a planet is selected, the camera smoothly zooms in, allowing users to observe the planet's rotation and view an information window with details about the planet.
- **Time Acceleration Slider:** Users can adjust a slider in the planet selection menu to speed up the rotation of planets, simulating time acceleration.
- **Clickable Planets and Orbits:** Users can click on a planet or its orbit to access information about the planet without using the menu.

## Technologies

- **Three.js:** A JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser.
